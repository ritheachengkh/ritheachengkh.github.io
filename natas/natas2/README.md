Once you log in, you’ll see a message saying there’s nothing on this page. 
Use **Ctrl + U** to view the source page.

In the source code, we noticed a directory called `files` that stores a file named `pixel.png`

So, we tried accessing it through the web browser.

Now we see a file named `users.txt`, so we clicked on it.

You’ll find the flag once you open it.
