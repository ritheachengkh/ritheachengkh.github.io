Welcome to my walkthrough documentation for the **Pre-Security Learning Path** on the **TryHackMe** platform.
This guide is designed to support **beginners in cybersecurity** by building the essential technical foundation needed to start your journey.
Before you can attack or defend any technology, it’s crucial to understand how that technology works — and that’s exactly what this path helps you achieve.

**Before hacking something, you first need to understand the basics:**
- **Cyber security basics** 
- **Networking basics and weaknesses** 
- **The web and common attacks** 
- **Learn to use the Linux operating system** 

💡 Note: I highly encourage you to **try each room on your own first**. Use this walkthrough only when you’re truly stuck or need a small push in the right direction.

This documentation serves as an educational companion, not a shortcut.
Stay curious, keep learning — and happy hacking! 🛡️💻
