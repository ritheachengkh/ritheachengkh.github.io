# 🔒 Overthewire-Krypton

Welcome to my walkthrough documentation for the **Krypton** wargame on the **OverTheWire** platform. This guide is designed to help new and aspiring CTF (Capture The Flag) players explore the fundamentals of cryptography, encoding, and encryption through hands-on, real-world-style challenges.

💡 Note: To keep the challenge engaging and to avoid spoilers, all flags beyond Krypton0 are intentionally blurred or hidden. I strongly encourage you to attempt each level on your own first. Use this walkthrough only when you’re stuck or need a nudge in the right direction.

This documentation is meant as an educational resource — not a shortcut. Happy hacking! 🔒🧩🛡️
