# Bandit Level 18 ‚Üí Level 19

## Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in a file readme in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified .bashrc to log you out when you log in with SSH.

## Commands you may need to solve this level

    ssh, ls, cat


### üîë Solution

```
ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
Then enter the password obtained from the previous challenge.

Oops! The connection closes right after you log in. As mentioned in the instructions, someone has edited the ``.bashrc`` file to log you out upon SSH login.

To work around this, you can add a command at the end of your SSH command to execute before the forced logout happens.
As you can see, the `ls` command executed before the session was closed.
```
ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 ls
```

When we appended the `cat` command to our SSH command, it executed before the session closed, and we got the flag.

Alternatively, we can use the ``-t`` flag in the SSH command along with a different shell path to forces a pseudo-terminal.

This option might bypass the logout behavior in ``.bashrc``.
```
ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -t /bin/sh
```

### üêö Common Linux Shells

| **Shell Name** | **Typical Path**               | **Interactive Features**           | **POSIX Compliant** |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Bash**       | `/bin/bash`                    | ‚úÖ Yes (completion, history, etc.) | ‚úÖ Mostly            |
| **Sh**         | `/bin/sh` (symlink)            | ‚ùå Minimal                         | ‚úÖ Yes               |
| **Dash**       | `/bin/dash`                    | ‚ùå Very minimal                    | ‚úÖ Yes               |
| **Zsh**        | `/bin/zsh` or `/usr/bin/zsh`   | ‚úÖ Rich features                   | ‚úÖ Yes               |
| **Fish**       | `/usr/bin/fish` or `/bin/fish` | ‚úÖ Modern, user-friendly           | ‚ùå No                |
| **Ksh**        | `/bin/ksh` or `/usr/bin/ksh`   | ‚úÖ Moderate features               | ‚úÖ Yes               |
| **Tcsh**       | `/usr/bin/tcsh`                | ‚úÖ Command-line editing            | ‚ùå No                |
| **Csh**        | `/bin/csh`                     | ‚úÖ Basic                           | ‚ùå No                |

This method can also work if we use the **Dash shell** instead.
```
ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -t /bin/dash
```

The command `cat /etc/shells` is used to display the list of valid login shells available on a Unix or Linux system. This file contains the paths to all the shells installed on the system that users can choose from.

Well done ‚Äî you‚Äôve discovered the flag needed for the next challenge.
