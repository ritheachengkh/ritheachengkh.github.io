Use the password from the previous stage. Everything should function correctly, but if an error appears, read the message carefully and double-check your command.

We used `git log`, `git show`, and `git branch`, but came up empty. What should we try next?

![b30s3](b30s3.png)

Running `git tag` revealed an interesting tag called *secret*, so we checked it with `git show`.
```
git tag
git show secret
```
