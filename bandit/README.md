Welcome to my walkthrough documentation for the **Bandit** wargame on **OverTheWire** platform. This guide is designed to help new and aspiring CTF (Capture The Flag) players navigate the early stages of learning Linux command-line skills through real-world-style challenges.

ðŸ’¡ Note: To keep the challenge engaging and to avoid spoilers, all flags beyond Bandit0 are intentionally blurred or hidden. I strongly encourage you to attempt each level on your own first. Use this walkthrough only when you're stuck or need a nudge in the right direction.

This documentation is meant as an educational resource â€” not a shortcut. Happy hacking!
