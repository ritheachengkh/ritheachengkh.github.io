Once you're logged in, you can confirm your current user by typing the command **whoami**.
The result should display: **bandit1**.
![b1s2](b1s2.png)

Next, you can use the **clear** command to clean up your terminal screen.
Then, type **pwd** to print your current working directory.
Use **ls** to list all the files ‚Äî you should see a file named -.
To view its contents, use the command:
```
cat <-
```
![b1s3](b1s3.png)

The file is named -, which can confuse the terminal because - is usually interpreted as an option flag.
< ‚Äì this is input redirection in the shell. It tells the shell:
‚ÄúTake input for this command from the file that follows.‚Äù

###### üìù Alternative Way to View a File Named -
```
cat ./-
or
cat -- -
```
./- specifies the exact path to the file, avoiding confusion with options or stdin.

-- is a common Unix/Linux convention used to prevent commands from misinterpreting filenames that start with dashes.

üéâ Nice job ‚Äî you found the flag! Don‚Äôt forget to save it for the next challenge.
