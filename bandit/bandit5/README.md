# Bandit Level 5 â†’ Level 6

## Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:

    human-readable
    1033 bytes in size
    not executable

## Commands you may need to solve this level

    ls , cd , cat , file , du , find

### ðŸ”‘ Solution

```
ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
Then enter the **password** obtained from the previous challenge.

First, use the `ls` command to list all files. Then, navigate into the inhere directory using `cd inhere`, and run `ls -al` to display detailed information about all files. The challenge is to identify the file that is humanâ€‘readable, 1033 bytes in size, and not executable.

To find the file, use the following command
```
find ~/inhere -type f -size 1033c ! -executable
or
find /home/bandit5/inhere -type f -size 1033c ! -executable
```
``~/inhere`` The directory to search. ``~`` mean current home directory which equivalent to ``/home/bandit5/inhere``  
``-type f`` Restricts results to regular files (not directories, symlinks, device files, etc.).  
``-size 1033c`` Matches files whose size is exactly 1033 bytes. The trailing c means "bytes" (characters)  
``! -executable`` Negates -executable â€” so this matches files that are not executable for the user running the command.  
The matching file is ``/home/bandit5/inhere/maybehere07/.file2``  
```
cat /home/bandit5/inhere/maybehere07/.file2
or
cd /home/bandit5/inhere/maybehere07/
cat .file2
```
