### ðŸ”‘ Solution

### ðŸ“‹ Useful Git Command
![git](git.jpg)

Use the `cd` command to go to the folder where you want to work, then execute `git clone` to download the *Bandit28* Git repository.
```
git clone ssh://bandit28-git@bandit.labs.overthewire.org:2220/home/bandit28-git/repo ~/Desktop/Bandits/repo28
```

Enter the password you get from the previous challenge. Everything should work smoothlyâ€”if you encounter any errors, read the error message carefully and verify your syntax.

![b28s2](b28s2.png)

If the clone was successful, youâ€™ll see a folder named `repo28`. Go into that directory using `cd repo28`, then list its contents with `ls` and display the `README.md` file using `cat`. Youâ€™ll notice that the password has been removed.

![b28s3](b28s3.png)

By running the `git log` command, we see three commits, one of which has the intriguing message ``"add missing data"``.


![b28s4](b28s4.png)

Next, we use the `git checkout` command.
```
git checkout 8b7c651b37ce7a94633b7b7b7c980ded19a16e4f
```
![b28s5](b28s5.png)

You should see a message indicating that we are switching to that commit.

![b28s6](b28s6.png)

Next, use the `cat` command to view the `README.md` file again. This time, you should see the password of bandit29.

![b28s7](b28s7.png)

You can also use the `git show` command as an alternative to `git checkout`.
```
git log
git show 8b7c651b37ce7a94633b7b7b7c980ded19a16e4f
```
