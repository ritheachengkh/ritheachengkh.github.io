### üîë Solution

Logging into Bandit 14 is slightly different, as it requires the ``-i`` flag this time. Ensure you are in the directory where you saved the SSH key from the previous challenge.

```
ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Oops, the server responded with a message about an **unprotected private key file** and **bad permissions**.

### Common Permission Examples
![rwx_permission](rwx_permission.jpg)

SSH private keys are **sensitive and must be kept secret**. If the permissions are too open (like 644), it means other users on the system can read your private key.

SSH enforces **strict permissions** on private keys as a security measure ‚Äî if the key file is accessible by others, SSH refuses to use it to protect you from potential unauthorized access.

No worries ‚Äî this can be fixed using the `chmod` command.  
``6 = rw- for the user (owner)``  
`0 = --- for the group`  
`0 = --- for others`  
```
chmod 600 sshkey.private
```

Try logging into Bandit14 again ‚Äî this time, it should work without any issues.
```
ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

As noted earlier, the password is stored at /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
```
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
```
![b14s4](b14s4.png)

As outlined in the instruction, submit the password for this level to port **30000** on **localhost** to retrieve the password for the next level.

To accomplish this, run the following command:
```
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 | nc localhost 30000
or
echo MU4V====================== | nc localhost 30000
```
`nc` Stands for **netcat** ‚Äî a command-line utility used for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP.  
`localhost` Refers to the **local machine** ‚Äî IP address **127.0.0.1**. This means the connection stays on your computer.  
`30000`: The **port number** to connect to.

Awesome! You‚Äôve successfully found the flag for the next stage.
