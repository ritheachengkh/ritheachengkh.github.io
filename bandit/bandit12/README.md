# Bandit Level 12 ‚Üí Level 13

## Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work. Use mkdir with a hard to guess directory name. Or better, use the command ‚Äúmktemp -d‚Äù. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)

## Commands you may need to solve this level

    grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd, mkdir, cp, mv, file

### üîë Solution

```
ssh bandid12@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
Next, input the password you retrieved in the previous challenge.

According to the instructions, we first need to create a directory inside the ``/tmp`` directory using either the `mkdir` or `mktemp -d` command.
The next step is to copy the data file to that directory.

You can accomplish this with the following command.
```
mkdir /tmp/folder123
cd /tmp/folder123
cp ~/data.txt .
```

Alternatively, consider using the command below
```
cd /tmp
mktemp -d
cd /tmp/tmp.ek44rvikoc
cp ~/data.txt .
```

You can also use the following command instead
```
cd /tmp
hard_to_guess=$(mktemp -d)
cd $hard_to_guess
cp ~/data.txt .
```

Since data.txt is a hexdump of a file that's been repeatedly compressed, the first step is to convert it back into its binary form with the command below.
```
mv data.txt data.hexdump && ls
xxd -r data.hexdump data.bin && ls
```
`xxd`	A command-line tool that creates a hex dump from a binary file ‚Äî or reverses a hex dump back into binary.  
``-r``	Reverse mode ‚Äî tells xxd to convert from a hex dump back to binary.  
`data.hexdump`	The input file, which contains a hex dump (text representation of binary data).  
`data.bin`	The output file, where the resulting binary data will be written.  

![b12s4](b12s4.png)

You can check what kind of file `data.bin` is by using the `file` command. The output indicates that the file is compressed using **gzip**.  

![b12s5](b12s5.png)

Next, use the following mv command to rename data.bin to data.gz, reflecting its gzip format.
```
mv data.bin data.gz && ls
```
![b12s6](b12s6.png)

Run the command below to decompress.
```
gunzip data.gz && ls
```
![b12s7](b12s7.png)

Now that we have the file named data, use the `file` command to check its format. If it‚Äôs identified as a bzip2 file, rename it using `mv` to give it a .bz2 extension.

```
file data
mv data data.bz2 && ls
```
![b12s8](b12s8.png)

Execute the following command to extract the contents.
```
bzip2 -d data.bz2 && ls
```
![b12s9](b12s9.png)

Repeat the same steps with the data file. The output will indicate that it is a **gzip** file.

![b12s10](b12s10.png)

Rename the file to have a .gz extension to indicate it‚Äôs a gzip file.

![b12s11](b12s11.png)

Apply the following command to decompress the file.
```
gzip -d data.gz && ls
or
gunzip data.gz && ls
```
![b12s12](b12s12.png)

Repeat the same process, and this time the output shows it is a **tar** file.

![b12s13](b12s13.png)

Modify the file‚Äôs name to mark it as a tar archive.

![b12s14](b12s14.png)

Execute the following command to extract the contents.
```
tar -xf data.tar && ls
```
![b12s15](b12s15.png)

Following the same steps for `data5.bin`, the output shows it is a **tar** file.

![b12s16](b12s16.png)

Adjust the filename to mark it as a tar archive.

![b12s17](b12s17.png)

To decompress, run the following command.
```
tar -xf data5.tar && ls
```
![b12s18](b12s18.png)

Following the same steps for the data6.bin file, it is identified as a bzip2 file.

![b12s19](b12s19.png)

Rename the file to have a .bz2 extension to indicate it‚Äôs a bzip2 file.

![b12s20](b12s20.png)

Apply the following command to decompress the file.
```
bunzip2 data6.bz2 && ls
or 
bzip2 -d data6.bz2 && ls
```
![b12s21](b12s21.png)

Repeat the steps for the data6 file ‚Äî it is identified as a **tar** archive.

![b12s22](b12s22.png)

Change the filename to include the .tar extension.

![b12s23](b12s23.png)

Run the following command to unpack the archive.
```
tar -xf data7.tar && ls
```
![b12s24](b12s24.png)

Using the same steps as before for `data8.bin` file ‚Äî it is identified as a gzip-compressed file.

![b12s25](b12s25.png)

Change the file‚Äôs name to end with .gz to match its compression type.

![b12s26](b12s26.png)

Decompress the file using the command below.
```
gzip -d data8.gz && ls
or
gunzip data8.gz && ls
```
![b12s27](b12s27.png)

Continuing with the same approach, process the data8 file ‚Äî it is identified as ASCII text, which is exactly what we were looking for.

![b12s28](b12s28.png)

Reveal the flag by running `cat` on the file.

![b12s29](b12s29.png)

Big congratulations for cracking the challenge and finding the flag! Excellent job! üéäüëè
